**NeWork — A Social Network for Professionals**

A diploma project created as part of a course to practice Android application development skills. The main goal was to create a platform where users can share professional achievements, establish social connections, and exchange media content.

**My Tasks and Contribution**
* Full application development: from design to implementation of all features.
* UI/UX work (main focus — ease of interaction with the post feed, maps, and media content).
* Integration of external services (maps, media).
* Ensuring proper functioning of CRUD operations for posts, events, and user profiles.

**Key Technologies**
MVVM, Room, Retrofit, OkHttp3, Dagger Hilt, Navigation, Glide, Yandex Mapkit, ExoPlayer.

**Challenges and Conclusions**
* Main challenge: bringing together all key modules and services.
* This project allowed me to refine basic Android development skills, learn to design architecture, and optimize data handling.
