**NeWork â€” A Social Network for Professionals**

A diploma project created to practice Android application development skills. The main goal was to create a platform where users can share professional achievements, establish social connections, and exchange media content.

**My Tasks and Contribution**

* Integration and work with external API (authentication, retrieving post data).
* UI/UX work: ease of interaction with the post feed, maps, and media content.
* Ensuring proper functioning of CRUD operations for posts, events, and user profiles.

**Key Technologies**
MVVM, Room, Retrofit, OkHttp3, Dagger Hilt, Navigation, Glide, Yandex Mapkit, ExoPlayer.

**Challenges and Conclusions**
* Main challenge: bringing together all key modules and integrating third-party API.
* This project allowed me to refine basic Android development skills, learn to design architecture, and work with external services.
